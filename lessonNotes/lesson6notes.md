### Lesson 6 Notes

1. Dr. Chuck calls looping the 4th basic pattern of computer programming. What are the other three patterns?\
The other three patterns are sequential, condition, and store and reuse.

2. Describe the program Dr. Chuck uses to introduce the while loop. What does it do?\
The program that Dr. Chuck created to introduce the while loop is a count down. The loop will start at 5 and count down by one each time. While counting down, the program will print the number that the countdown is on. After the countdown reaches 0, "Blastoff!" will be printed as well as the number the countdown ended on, which would be 0.

3. What is another word for looping introduced in the video?\
Another word for looping is known as iterating.

4. Dr. Chuck shows us a broken example of a loop. What is this kind of loop called? What is wrong with it?\
This is called an infinite loop. As the name suggests, this loop will iterate over an infinite amount of time. Thus, the program will never end. This occurs because a loop was written with no way to exit out of it.

5. What Python statement (a new keyword for us, by the way) can be used to exit a loop?\
We can use `break` to exit a loop.

6. What is the other loop control statement introduced in the first video? What does it do?\
The other loop control statement is `continue`. Unlike `break` where it tells the program to stop iterating and exit the loop, `continue` tells the program to stop iterating, go back up to the loop, and run the loop again.

7. Dr. Chuck ends the first video by saying that a while is what type of loop? Why are they called that? What is the type of loop he says will be discussed next?\
He says while loops are called "indefinite loops." He calls it this because while loops will keep running until its condition becomes `False`. We will discuss about definite loops next.

8. Which new Python loop is introduced in the second video? How does it work?\ 
The for loop is introduced in this video. `for` uses an iteration variable (commonly `i`). The for loop will iterate over a sequence, like an array, using the iteration variable and for each item in the sequence, the program will do whatever the code says to do in the for loop. A for loop is usually used when the programmer knows how many times they want to loop a code.

9. The third video introduces what Dr. Chuck calls loop idioms. What does he mean by that term? Which examples of loop idioms does he introduce in this and the fourth video?\
Loop idioms are patterns created when programmers construct loops. In the video, Dr. Chuck created a for loop that finds the largest number in an array. He creates a pattern by first assigning -1 to `largest_so_far` and then tells the for loop to iterate over the array. When iterating, the for loop will compare the number value in a certain index with the index before it and the bigger number will be printed out after each iteration. When the for loop ends, the largest number in the array will be printed out.
