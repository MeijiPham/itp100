### Lesson 5 Notes

1. How can we use Markdown and git to create nice looking documents under revision control?\
   Markdown is a language similar to HTML that allows us to format documents. This can help with organization and make
   things look cleaner. Git helps with revision control as it tells programmers what edits were made and who made these    edits. It also allows programmers to revert back to a previous set of code with ease if they messed up. These
   features help tremendously in group projects.

2. Dr. Chuck describes functions as store and reused pattern in programming. Explain what he means by this.\
   Functions are like recipes. There are a set of instructions that people must follow. When creating functions, programmers are creating a set of instructions and storing it in a recipe for the computer to read. And similar to a recipe, functions can be reused over and over again to create the same thing. Functions are crucial in programming as they allow programmers to reuse code and helps them with organization.

3. How do we create functions in Python? What new keyword do we use? Provide your own example of a function written in Python. 
We can create functions in Python by using the keyword `def`.

```
def introduction():
    print("Hello there!")
    print("How are you doing?")


introduction()

Hello there!
How are you doing?
```

In this example, a function called `introduction()` has been created using the command `def`. In the function, there are two commands that will print a string each. When `introduction()` is called, the commands in the function will be read, from top to bottom, and print out the two strings.

4. Dr. Chuck shows that nothing is output when you define a function, what he calls the store phase. What does he call the process that makes the function run? He uses two words for this, and it is really important to understand this idea and learn the words for it.\
The process that makes the function run is called the "reuse" phase.

5. Provide some examples of built-in function in Python.\
Some examples of built-in function in Python includes `int()`, `parseInt()`, `float()`, `print()`, and `type()`.
